<!--Accessibility considerations
Opening links in a new tab or window can cause accessibility issues. Here are some reasons why: Links opening in a new tab can prove disorienting for people with low vision or are navigating via screen reader, especially when there is no warning. However, using iframe to package content within a modal also raises accessibility concerns-->

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>This class taught me the importance of understanding how rhetoric shapes communication, how technology influences creative tools and processes, and whether ethics is responsible and influential in what we have created. I want to learn how to make a design that is effective, meaningful, and socially conscious by critically evaluating these factors.</p>

            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>Strong foundations of design principles such as balance, alignment, contrast, and hierarchical structure are essential for creating engaging and functional pieces. I applied these principles to the project, which helped me communicate clearly and engage the audience effectively.</p>

              <p>Great design comes from repetition. Looking at other students' works, I feel my shortcomings through various media formats such as text, visual materials, multimedia, etc. Thus, I want to make a better design while fixing my shortcomings.</p>

I explored how rhetoric shapes the way we persuade and communicate with diverse audiences through visual and text.

               <p>In this course, I practiced revision as an essential part of the creative process, making changes within a single project and across different types of media like print, digital, and accessible formats. I learned how adapting my work to different forms often required rethinking design choices, language, and structure to fit new audiences and contexts. Revising across media taught me to be flexible, thoughtful, and more strategic as a designer. This process helped me see revision as an opportunity for growth rather than just correction.</p>
